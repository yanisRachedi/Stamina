# Instamint

# Introduction

_Instamint_ is a young startup which allows NFTs & crypto enthusiasts to discover, collect and exchange NFTs and much more!

Founded by Richard Lenoir, Rackham Lerouge et Ren√© Leblanc, who share a common passion for digital art and the blockchain, the company's focus is to be more than just a marketplace for NFTs. Indeed, _Instamint_ wants to create a large community of digital art enthusiasts but also bring in experts and galleries in order to create a real ecosystem which lives in symbioses.

_Instamint_ is looking for a developer team to build the first version of their product, which will be referred as the `alpha` in this document. While we mainly focus our call for tenders to provide a detailed offer for the `alpha`, we are open to receive offers including in their quote the next version (which is called `beta`).

# Functional Specifications

## Misc

- all public URLs must be "crawlable" by SEO crawlers (i.e you must render HTML pages, no full dynamic pages), which includes public pages such as "terms", "privacy policy", etc.;
- not signed users must be greeted with a privacy & data collection popup asking their permission according to the laws of their countries' laws.

## Terms

### _MINT_

Instead of using "likes" we are using "mints" represented by a small mint icon.

# Technical specifications & limits

As we are building a marketplace, we are very demanding on the quality of the technical work as much as on the legal part.

The following must be implemented and enforced in the deliverables and processes of the offer:

- all written code must be properly linted;
- all written code must follow best practice in terms of security, maintainability and readability;

- the database choice must be the best fit for a e-commerce marketplace app and ensure data integrity;
- the platform must be architected to handle large loads (> 1000 req/s) and thus be scalable in all aspects (scalable reads & writes).

## Design Specifications

- We want you to be creative and are open to new ideas!
- We would like to provide you only with a few constraints such as our logo, a palette, etc.;
- All sizes which are not expressed in % must be done with `rem` and translated from a unit sized defined below. This will ensure that the app will resize properly according the selected font size and thus be as responsive to zooming as possible;
- You may change everything as long as you validate it with us first;

## Security

At _Instamint_, we are very serious and regarding when it comes to security as we are dealing our customers assets, may they amount to a very large or little value. Thus, the following requirements are mandatory to make the offer acceptable:

- all third-party services/providers accounts must be protected with a unique password and if MFA is available, must be activated;
- all third-party source code must assessed and audited through third-party services;
- the whole source code of the project or any configuration file must _not_ contain any "secrets" or confidential data, as well as the source code repository itself, in any way, be it in its current state or in saved past versions;
- passwords and more generally any sensitive information must be following best practices in terms of generation, storage and access.

# Sustainability

As much as we love NFTs, we love sustainability too and are aware of the impact it may cause. As such we believe that digital art is a much _greener_ way to consume art in general. Yet, we think it's not enough and we require all offers to provide a sustainable solution, in compliance with the direction taken by the European Green Deal and more specifically European Climate Law.

Obviously, we understand that any service will inevitably produce opposite effect on sustainability, but we believe that different measures can be found to limit and reduce it.

We would like to hint at the hosting services which offer sustainable solutions, but also at the possibilities pertaining to the overall architecture of the offer.
